- This project presents a conceptual design for an autonomous AI system that detects anomalies in satellite imagery.
The goal is to support NASA missions by automatically identifying critical events such as wildfires, floods, environmental changes, and unexpected surface activity — without requiring constant human oversight.
By integrating deep learning models with real-time satellite data streams, the system aims to dramatically improve disaster response times, mission safety, and operational efficiency.
